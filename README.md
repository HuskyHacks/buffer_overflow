# buffer_overflow
Jupyter Notebook for Vanilla Buffer Overflow

This repository demonstrates the use of a Jupyter Notebook to develop a basic stack buffer overflow as taught by Justin Steven (https://github.com/justinsteven/dostackbufferoverflowgood).


Some interesting aspects:

- We're demonstrating how to use Python3
- Notebooks enable us to have all the steps in a single file
- Bash commands can be run inside the notebook and integrated with the rest of the Python workflow
- Notes can be kept within the notebook (e.g. Mona commands)
